It integrates multiple methods to predict protein domain boundaries, including the domain conservation score, the secondary structure, the relative solvent accessibility, the accessible surface area, and domain functions. The server also provides a user-friendly interface for users to edit the predicted domain boundaries and to detect the discontinuous domains.",
